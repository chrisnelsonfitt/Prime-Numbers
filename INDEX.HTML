  <h1>The Prime Challenge</h1>
  <p>Create a page that will both tell you whether a number is prime or not and generate all prime numbers between two given numbers. Fork this Codepen (see top bar) and send us what you come up with.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul class="container">
      <li>There shouldn't be a submit button anywhere on this page, it should generate results as the user types.</li>
      <li>There should be form valiation, if the user puts in a non-integer show an error message.</li>
      <li>This is your chance to show us some design skills as well. Make this responsive and look decent. You don't need to spend a ton of time on this, but make it better than it is now.</li>
      <li>Feel free to look at algorithms that exist already for determining prime numbers, you don't need to create your own algorithm. I'd recommend the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</li>
    </ul>
